Library Management System

Description:
The Library Management System is a Java application designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing a library's collection of books and users. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding books and users, borrowing and returning books, and searching for books by different criteria such as author, title, or user ID.

Features:

Add Book: Users can add new books to the library by providing details such as title, author, genre, and book ID.
Add User: Users can add new library users by providing details such as name, email, phone number, and user ID.
Display Books: Users can view the list of books currently available in the library.
Borrow Book: Users can borrow books by specifying the book ID and their user ID.
Return Book: Users can return borrowed books by specifying the book ID and their user ID.
Search Books: Users can search for books by different criteria such as author, title, or user ID.

Installation:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Download or clone the repository containing the source code.
Compile the Java files using javac command.
Run the compiled program using java command.

Usage:

Upon running the program, the Library Management System GUI will appear.
Use the provided buttons to perform various actions such as adding books, adding users, borrowing books, returning books, displaying books, and searching books.
Follow the on-screen instructions and input necessary details when prompted.
Error messages will be displayed if any input validation fails or if an operation encounters an issue.
Close the program window when finished.

Using WindowsBuilder:
The Library Management System GUI is built using WindowsBuilder, an Eclipse plugin that simplifies the creation of Java GUI applications. It provides a visual editor for designing GUI components and generates corresponding Java code.
To modify the GUI using WindowsBuilder:

Open the project in Eclipse IDE.
Navigate to the Java class containing the GUI components (e.g., LibraryManagementSystem.java).
Right-click on the file and select "Open With" > "WindowBuilder Editor".
Use the visual editor to make desired changes to the GUI layout and components.
Save the changes, and WindowsBuilder will automatically generate the corresponding Java code.
